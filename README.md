# KP-Meble

Website design for the company KP Meble, which creates custom-made furniture.

The website was created using HTML, Sass preprocessor and JavaScript. Made in the SPA methodology.
In this project I used such JS libraries as Swiper (responsible for the photo gallery) and SmtpJS (responsible for sending messages by the user tko the declared email address). I also used animation when loading the page and scrolling the content (sections).
The website was also designed for mobile devices in accordance with the RWD methodology.
